# A C++ Versition of TDD

## Overview
Decision diagrams have been used in the simulation and equivalence checking of quantum circuits. Inspired by the efficiency and flexibility of Tensor Networks. A tensor network-based decision diagram has been proposed at https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3514355. This repository gives a C++ implementation of the Tensor Decision Diagram(TDD), and the package is developed based on the DD package used in mqt-core https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-core.
